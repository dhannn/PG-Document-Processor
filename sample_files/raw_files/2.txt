Information retrieval (IR) in computing and information science is the process 
of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information 
need from a collection of those resources. Searches can be based on full-text or 
other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science[1] of 
searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and 
also searching for the metadata that describes data, and for databases of texts, 
images or sounds.

Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called 
information overload. An IR system is a software system that provides access to 
books, journals and other documents; stores and manages those documents. Web 
search engines are the most visible IR applications.
