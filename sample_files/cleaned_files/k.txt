symbol house whether auditory motor visual experience image attached single image particular house seen might perhaps indulgent criticism termed element speech yet obvious outset speech constituted little value purposes communication world experiences must enormously simplified generalized possible make symbolic inventory experiences things relations inventory imperative convey ideas elements

interpreted record setting concepts mutual relations question often raised whether thought possible without speech speech thought facets psychic process question difficult hedged misunderstandings

illusion seems due number factors simplest failure distinguish imagery thought matter fact sooner try put image conscious relation another find slipping silent flow words thought natural domain apart artificial speech speech seem road know leads still fruitful source illusive feeling language dispensed thought common failure realize language identical auditory symbolism auditory symbolism replaced point point motor visual symbolism many people read instance purely visual sense without intermediating link inner flow auditory images correspond printed written words still subtle elusive types transfer easy define hence contention thinks without language merely aware coexisting auditory imagery far indeed valid go far suspect symbolic expression thought cases run along outside fringe conscious mind feeling free nonlinguistic stream thought minds certain type relatively relatively justified psycho physically mean auditory equivalent visual motor centers brain together appropriate

successfully effected hearer auditory perceptions translated appropriate intended flow imagery thought combined hence cycle speech far look upon purely external instrument begins ends realm sounds concordance initial auditory imagery final auditory perceptions social seal warrant successful issue process already seen typical course process undergo endless modifications transfers equivalent systems without thereby losing essential formal characteristics important modifications abbreviation speech process involved thinking doubtless many forms according structural functional peculiarities individual mind least modified form known talking self thinking aloud speaker hearer identified single person said communicate significant still abbreviated form sounds speech articulated belong varieties silent speech normal thinking auditory centers alone excited impulse linguistic expression communicated well motor nerves communicate organs speech inhibited either muscles organs point motor nerves possibly auditory centers slightly affected speech process manifesting directly motor sphere must still types abbreviation common excitation motor nerves silent speech audible visible articulations result shown frequent experience fatigue speech organs particularly larynx unusually stimulating reading intensive thinking modifications far considered directly patterned typical

communication undoubtedly varies widely individual even conceivable exactly likely certain operators learned think directly far purely conscious part process thought concerned terms tick auditory symbolism happen strong natural bent toward motor symbolism terms correlated tactile motor symbolism developed sending telegraphic messages still another interesting group transfers different gesture languages developed use deaf mutes trappist monks vowed perpetual silence communicating parties within seeing distance earshot systems equivalences normal system speech others like military gesture symbolism gesture language plains indians north america understood tribes mutually unintelligible forms speech imperfect transfers limiting rendering grosser speech elements imperative minimum difficult circumstances latter systems still imperfect symbolisms used sea woods contended language longer properly plays part ideas directly conveyed utterly unrelated symbolic process quasi instinctive imitativeness interpretation erroneous intelligibility vaguer symbolisms hardly due anything automatic silent translation terms fuller flow speech shall doubt conclude voluntary communication ideas aside normal speech either transfer direct indirect typical symbolism language spoken heard least involves intermediary truly linguistic symbolism fact highest importance auditory imagery correlated motor imagery leading articulation whatever devious ways follow process historic fountain head speech thinking point still greater importance ease speech symbolism transferred sense another technique technique indicates mere sounds speech essential fact language lies rather classification formal patterning relating concepts language structure inner face mold thought abstracted
