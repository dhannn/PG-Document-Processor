precipices good fliers unlikely exterminated common rock pigeon habits domestic breeds exterminated even several smaller british islets shores mediterranean hence supposed extermination many species similar habits rock pigeon seems rash assumption moreover several named domesticated breeds transported parts world therefore must carried back native country ever become wild feral though dovecot

authors believe long continued domestication eliminates strong tendency sterility history dog think probability hypothesis applied species closely related together though unsupported single experiment extend hypothesis far suppose species aboriginally distinct carriers tumblers pouters fantails yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se seems rash extreme several reasons namely improbability man formerly got supposed species pigeons breed freely domestication supposed species quite unknown wild state becoming nowhere feral species abnormal characters certain respects compared columbid though like respects rock pigeon blue colour various marks occasionally appearing breeds kept pure crossed mongrel offspring perfectly fertileseveral reasons taken together feel doubt domestic breeds
