domesticated animals still capable rapid improvement modification disputed period life causes variability whatever generally act whether early late period development embryo instant conception geoffroy st hilaire experiments show unnatural treatment embryo causes monstrosities monstrosities cannot separated clear line distinction mere variations strongly inclined suspect frequent cause variability attributed male female reproductive elements affected prior act conception several reasons make believe chief remarkable effect confinement cultivation functions reproductive system system appearing far susceptible part organisation action change conditions life nothing easy tame animal things difficult get breed freely confinement even many cases male female unite many animals breed though living long close confinement native country generally attributed vitiated instincts many cultivated plants display utmost vigour yet rarely never seed cases found trifling changes little less water particular period growth determine whether plant sets seed cannot enter copious details collected curious subject show singular laws determine reproduction animals confinement mention carnivorous animals even tropics breed country pretty freely confinement exception plantigrades bear family whereas carnivorous birds rarest exceptions hardly ever lay fertile eggs many exotic plants pollen utterly worthless exact condition sterile hybrids hand see domesticated animals plants though often weak sickly yet breeding quite freely confinement hand see individuals though taken young state nature perfectly tamed long lived healthy give numerous instances yet reproductive system seriously affected unperceived causes fail acting need surprised system act confinement acting quite regularly producing offspring perfectly like parents variable sterility said bane horticulture view owe variability cause produces sterility variability source choicest productions garden add organisms breed freely unnatural conditions instance rabbit ferret kept hutches showing reproductive system thus affected animals plants withstand domestication cultivation vary slightly perhaps hardly state nature long list easily given sporting plants term gardeners mean single bud offset suddenly assumes new sometimes different character rest plant buds propagated grafting etc sometimes seed sports extremely rare nature far rare cultivation case see treatment parent affected bud offset ovules pollen opinion physiologists essential difference bud ovule earliest stages formation fact

seedlings fruit young litter sometimes differ considerably though young parents m ller remarked apparently exposed exactly conditions life shows unimportant direct effects conditions life comparison laws reproduction growth inheritance action conditions direct young varied probably varied manner judge much case variation attribute direct action heat moisture light food etc difficult impression animals agencies produced little direct effect though apparently case plants point view mr buckman recent experiments plants seem extremely valuable nearly individuals exposed certain conditions

suggested authors drooping due disuse muscles ear animals much alarmed danger seems probable many laws regulating variation dimly seen hereafter briefly mentioned allude called correlation growth change embryo larva almost certainly entail changes mature animal monstrosities correlations quite distinct parts curious many instances given isidore geoffroy st hilaire great work subject breeders

almost certainly unconsciously modify parts structure owing mysterious laws correlation growth result various quite unknown dimly seen laws variation infinitely complex diversified well worth carefully study several treatises published old cultivated plants hyacinth potato even dahlia etc really surprising note endless points structure constitution varieties sub varieties differ slightly whole organisation seems become plastic tends depart small degree parental type variation inherited unimportant number diversity inheritable deviations structure slight considerable physiological importance endless dr prosper lucas treatise large volumes fullest best subject breeder doubts strong tendency inheritance like produces like fundamental belief doubts thrown principle theoretical writers alone deviation appears unfrequently see father child cannot tell whether due original cause acting amongst individuals apparently exposed conditions rare deviation due extraordinary combination circumstances appears parent say amongst several million individuals reappears child mere doctrine chances almost compels attribute reappearance inheritance every must heard cases albinism

naturalists namely domestic varieties run wild gradually certainly revert character aboriginal stocks hence argued deductions drawn domestic races species state nature vain endeavoured discover decisive facts statement often boldly made great difficulty proving truth safely conclude many strongly marked domestic varieties possibly live wild state many cases know aboriginal stock tell whether nearly perfect reversion ensued quite necessary order prevent effects intercrossing single variety turned loose new home nevertheless varieties certainly occasionally revert characters ancestral forms seems improbable succeed naturalising cultivate many generations several races instance cabbage poor soil case however effect attributed direct action poor soil large extent even wholly revert wild aboriginal stock whether experiment succeed great importance line argument experiment conditions life changed shown domestic varieties manifested strong tendency reversion lose acquired characters whilst kept unchanged conditions whilst kept considerable body free intercrossing might check blending together slight deviations structure case grant deduce nothing domestic varieties regard species shadow evidence favour view assert breed cart race horses long short horned cattle poultry various breeds esculent vegetables almost infinite number generations opposed experience add nature conditions life change variations reversions character probably occur natural selection hereafter explained determine far new characters thus arising shall preserved look hereditary varieties races domestic animals plants compare species closely allied together generally perceive domestic race already remarked less uniformity character true species domestic races species also often somewhat monstrous character mean although differing species genus several trifling respects often differ extreme degree part compared another especially compared species nature nearest allied exceptions perfect fertility varieties crossed subject hereafter discussed domestic races species differ manner cases lesser degree closely allied species genus state nature think must admitted find hardly domestic races either amongst animals plants ranked competent judges mere varieties competent judges descendants aboriginally distinct species marked distinction existed domestic races species source doubt perpetually recur often stated domestic races differ characters generic value think shown statement hardly correct naturalists differ widely determining characters generic value valuations present empirical moreover view origin genera shall presently give right expect often meet generic differences domesticated productions attempt estimate amount structural difference domestic races species soon involved doubt knowing whether descended several parent species point cleared interesting instance shown greyhound bloodhound terrier spaniel bull dog know propagate kind truly offspring single species facts great weight making doubt immutability many closely allied natural species instance many foxes inhabiting different quarters world believe shall presently see dogs descended wild species case domestic races presumptive even strong evidence favour view often assumed man chosen domestication animals plants extraordinary inherent tendency vary likewise withstand diverse climates dispute capacities added largely value domesticated productions savage possibly know first tamed animal whether vary succeeding generations whether endure climates little variability ass guinea fowl small power endurance warmth rein deer cold common camel prevented domestication cannot doubt animals plants equal number domesticated productions belonging equally diverse classes countries taken state nature made breed equal number generations domestication vary average largely parent species existing domesticated productions varied case anciently domesticated animals plants think possible come definite conclusion whether descended several species argument mainly relied believe multiple origin domestic animals find ancient records especially monuments egypt much diversity breeds breeds closely resemble perhaps identical still existing even latter fact found strictly generally true seems case show breeds originated thousand years ago mr horner researches rendered degree probable man sufficiently civilized manufactured pottery existed valley nile thirteen fourteen thousand years ago pretend say long ancient periods savages like tierra del fuego australia possess semi domestic dog

mammal france distinct germany conversely hungary spain etc kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds cattle sheep etc must admit many domestic breeds originated europe whence derived several countries possess number peculiar species distinct parent stocks india even case domestic dogs whole world fully admit probably descended several wild species cannot doubt immense amount inherited variation believe animals closely resembling italian greyhound bloodhound bull dog blenheim spaniel etc unlike wild canid ever existed freely state nature often loosely said races dogs produced crossing aboriginal species crossing get forms degree intermediate parents account several domestic races process must admit former existence extreme forms italian greyhound bloodhound bull dog etc wild state moreover possibility making distinct races crossing greatly exaggerated doubt race modified occasional crosses aided careful selection individual mongrels present desired character race obtained nearly intermediate extremely different races species hardly believe sir j sebright expressly experimentised object failed offspring first cross pure breeds tolerably sometimes found pigeons extremely uniform everything seems simple enough mongrels crossed another several generations hardly alike extreme difficulty rather utter hopelessness task becomes apparent certainly breed

lesser number instance pouter produced crossing breeds unless parent stocks possessed characteristic enormous crop supposed aboriginal stocks must rock pigeons breeding willingly perching trees besides c livia geographical sub species species rock pigeons known characters domestic breeds hence supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist countries originally domesticated yet unknown ornithologists considering size habits remarkable characters seems improbable must become extinct wild state birds breeding precipices good fliers unlikely exterminated common rock pigeon habits domestic breeds exterminated even several smaller british islets shores mediterranean hence supposed extermination many species similar habits rock pigeon seems rash assumption moreover several named domesticated breeds transported parts world therefore must carried back native country ever become wild feral though dovecot pigeon rock pigeon slightly altered state become feral several places recent experience shows difficult get wild animal breed freely domestication yet hypothesis multiple origin pigeons must assumed least species thoroughly domesticated ancient times half civilized man

rock pigeon say within dozen twenty generations know fact countenancing belief child ever reverts ancestor removed greater number generations breed crossed distinct breed tendency reversion character derived cross naturally become less less succeeding generation less foreign blood cross distinct breed tendency parents revert character lost former generation tendency see contrary transmitted undiminished indefinite number generations distinct cases often confounded treatises inheritance lastly hybrids mongrels domestic breeds pigeons perfectly fertile state observations purposely made distinct breeds difficult perhaps impossible bring forward case hybrid offspring animals clearly distinct perfectly fertile authors believe long continued domestication eliminates strong tendency sterility history dog think probability hypothesis applied species closely related together though unsupported single experiment extend hypothesis far suppose species aboriginally distinct carriers tumblers pouters fantails yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se seems rash extreme several reasons namely improbability man formerly got supposed species pigeons breed freely domestication supposed species quite unknown wild state becoming nowhere feral species abnormal characters certain respects compared columbid though like respects rock pigeon blue colour various marks occasionally appearing breeds kept pure crossed mongrel offspring perfectly fertile several reasons taken together feel doubt domestic breeds descended columba livia geographical sub species favour view add firstly c livia rock pigeon found capable domestication europe india agrees habits great number points structure domestic breeds secondly although english carrier short faced tumbler differs immensely
