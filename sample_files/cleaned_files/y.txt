mats cover sides rooms pandan straws description pandans pandans screw pines sometimes called readily recognized characteristic appearance common forms occasionally planted pots house plants gardens often found growing wild long rather narrow leaves always supplied less sharp spines run along margins tip another row spines present surface along midrib bearing mind middle row spines impossible mistake leaf pandan pineapple maguey resembles less form shape another prominent feature pandans presence air prop roots grow stem ground helpful plant various ways veins leaves always run parallel longitudinal direction leaves never borne petiole attached directly winding corkscrew fashion ranks stem pandans true tropical shrubs trees although also found subtropics australia never occur temperate regions except raised ornamental plants greenhouses even distribution tropics limited found growing wild tropical regions old world especially islands lying mainland australia southeastern asia hardly ever cultivated occur found sufficient quantity purposes put essentially seacoast open swamp forms generally found low altitudes appearing find moist warm climate congenial growth philippines occur provinces though always sufficient quantity make commercial importance structure pandans presents many exceedingly interesting characteristics well worth noticing plants low leaves wider blade grass others form large trees leaves many meters long several decimeters wide spines generally occur along whole margin leaf though forms especially cultivated varieties present tip wanting entirely marginal spines usually curve forward vary size small hardly perceptible forms large sharp conical structures times set close together several centimeters apart midrib often curve backwards vary marginal spines generally spines green color though species pale green red black white forms seem creep along ground others low bushy standing close together form numerous supporting prop roots almost impenetrable jungle high tree forms striking peculiarly shaped crowns first roots pandans develop soon disappear place taken others starting high ground grow angle stem generally reach soil serve twofold purpose supporting stem supplying sufficient air accident underground roots die plant relies entirely air prop roots support food strong prop roots generally diameter throughout though sometimes thicken ends normally never branch ground reaching soil often divide tip roots protected cap layer cork tissue prevents drying root body pandan kinds flowers male female male flowers arranged form spike protected modified leaf called bract white color crowded together spike consist stamens hold pollen flowers showy colored bracts forms prominent feature many plants female flowers consist necessary parts pollen occurs enormous quantities plants generally grow groups probable flowers pollinated wind fact many pandans fragrant blossoms makes almost certain majority cases insect pollination takes place forms disagreeable odor pollination effected night flying insects fruit commonly general shape female inflorescence matures increases greatly size pandans composite fruit made smaller fruits called drupes common forms resemble pineapple leafy fruit apex cut natural variations type occur cylindrical eggshaped jackfruit like forms quite common largest cm long weigh kilos smallest cm length grams weight fruit occur solitary end branch groups color green though species change bright red maturity reached fruit drupes ranging mm mm length contain seed number seeds maturity drupes separate fruit falls apart plant occurs along water seeds liberated float rest suitable place germination uses pandans pandans valued chiefly strong fibrous leaves woven mats bags hats unless specially prepared soft plant tissue harder leaf fibers becomes dry dirty breaks time hence ordinary pandan bag mat considered durable article however treated boiling process

greater strength possible also sarakat economic pandan bangui peninsula ilocos norte variety p tectorius varieties common pandan sabutan botanical question among botanists whether pandan known sabutan variety common sea shore pandan p tectorius whether sufficient distinctive characteristics entitle considered separate species p sabotan botanists yet succeeded securing fruit pandan settle question doubtful whether fruit ever found prof ugolino martelli florence italy authority pandans considers sabutan pandanus tectorius var sinensis classification present accepted evidence favor determination paper sabutan therefore considered variety common pandan chief change generations planting production leaf stronger thinner finer texture parent stock sabutan plant never found growing wild though
