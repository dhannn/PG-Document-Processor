number precepts logic composed believed following prove perfectly sufficient provided took firm unwavering resolution never single instance fail observing first never accept anything true clearly know say carefully avoid precipitancy prejudice comprise nothing judgement presented mind clearly distinctly exclude ground doubt second divide difficulties examination many parts possible might necessary adequate solution third conduct thoughts order commencing objects simplest easiest know might ascend little little step step knowledge complex assigning thought certain order even objects nature stand relation antecedence sequence last every case make enumerations complete reviews general might assured nothing omitted long chains simple easy reasonings means geometers accustomed reach conclusions difficult demonstrations led imagine things knowledge man competent mutually connected way nothing far removed beyond reach hidden cannot discover provided abstain accepting false true always preserve thoughts order necessary deduction truth another little difficulty determining objects necessary commence already persuaded must simplest easiest know considering hitherto sought truth sciences mathematicians alone able find demonstrations certain evident reasons doubt must rule investigations resolved commence therefore examination simplest objects anticipating however advantage found accustoming mind love nourishment truth distaste reasonings unsound intention account attempting master particular sciences commonly denominated mathematics observing however different objects agree considering various relations proportions subsisting among objects thought best purpose consider proportions general form possible without referring objects particular except facilitate knowledge without means restricting afterwards might thus better able apply every class objects legitimately applicable perceiving order understand relations sometimes consider sometimes bear mind embrace aggregate thought order better consider individually view subsisting straight lines find objects simple capable distinctly represented imagination senses hand order retain memory embrace aggregate many express certain characters briefest possible way believed borrow best geometrical analysis algebra correct defects help point fact accurate observance precepts gave take liberty saying ease unraveling questions embraced sciences months devoted examination reach solutions questions formerly deemed exceedingly difficult even regards questions solution continued ignorant enabled appeared determine means whereby extent solution possible results attributable circumstance commenced simplest general truths thus truth discovered rule available discovery subsequent ones perhaps shall appear vain considered truth particular point whoever apprehends truth knows point known child example instructed elements arithmetic made particular addition according rule assured found respect sum numbers instance within reach human genius conclusion method teaches adherence true order exact enumeration conditions thing sought includes gives certitude rules arithmetic chief ground satisfaction thus method assurance thereby exercising reason matters absolute perfection least greatest attainable besides conscious use mind becoming gradually habituated clearer distinct conceptions objects hoped also restricted method particular matter apply difficulties sciences less success algebra however account ventured examination difficulties sciences presented contrary order prescribed method observing knowledge dependent principles borrowed philosophy found nothing certain thought necessary first endeavor establish principles observed besides inquiry kind others greatest moment precipitancy anticipation judgment dreaded thought ought approach till reached mature age time twenty first employed much time preparation work well eradicating mind erroneous opinions moment accepted amassing variety experience afford materials reasonings continually exercising chosen method view increased skill application part iii finally enough commencing rebuild house live pulled materials builders provided engage work according plan beforehand carefully drawn likewise necessary furnished house live commodiously operations might remain irresolute actions reason compelled suspend judgement might prevented living thenceforward greatest possible felicity formed provisory code morals composed maxims desirous make acquainted first obey laws customs country adhering firmly faith grace god educated childhood regulating conduct every matter according moderate opinions farthest removed extremes happen adopted practice general consent judicious among might living time begun hold opinions nought wished subject examination convinced better follow meantime opinions judicious although perhaps among persians chinese judicious among expediency seemed dictate regulate practice conformably opinions live appeared order ascertain real opinions ought rather take cognizance practised said corruption manners disposed speak exactly believe also many aware really believe act mind thing believed different know believe act often found without also amid many opinions held equal repute chose always moderate much reason always convenient practice probably best excess generally vicious event falling error might less distance truth chosen extremes turn ought adopted placed class extremes especially promises somewhat freedom abridged disapproved laws provide instability men feeble resolution sought accomplished good permit engagements vows contracts binding parties persevere even security commerce sanction similar engagements purpose sought realized indifferent find anything earth wholly superior change particular hoped gradually perfect judgments suffer deteriorate deemed grave sin good sense reason approved something particular time therefore bound hold good subsequent time perhaps ceased ceased esteem second maxim firm resolute actions able adhere less steadfastly doubtful opinions adopted highly certain imitating example travelers lost way forest ought wander side side far less remain place proceed constantly towards side straight line possible without changing direction slight reasons although perhaps might chance alone first determined selection way exactly reach point desire come least end place probably preferable middle forest way since action frequently happens delay permissible certain power determine true ought act according probable even although remark greater probability opinion another ought notwithstanding choose afterwards consider far relates practice longer dubious manifestly true certain since reason choice determined possessed qualities principle sufficient thenceforward rid repentings pangs remorse usually disturb consciences feeble uncertain minds destitute clear determinate principle choice allow day adopt course action best abandon next opposite third maxim endeavor always conquer rather fortune change desires rather order world general accustom persuasion except thoughts nothing absolutely power done best things external wherein fail success held regards absolutely impossible single principle seemed sufficient prevent desiring future anything obtain thus render contented since naturally seeks objects alone understanding represents way possible attainment plain consider external goods equally beyond power shall regret absence goods seem due birth deprived without fault possessing kingdoms china mexico thus making speak virtue necessity shall desire health disease freedom imprisonment bodies incorruptible diamonds wings birds fly confess need prolonged discipline frequently repeated meditation accustom mind view objects light believe chiefly consisted secret power philosophers former times enabled rise superior influence fortune amid suffering poverty enjoy happiness gods might envied occupied incessantly consideration limits prescribed power nature became entirely convinced nothing disposal except thoughts conviction sufficient prevent entertaining desire objects thoughts acquired sway absolute ground account esteeming rich powerful free happy men whatever favors heaped nature fortune destitute philosophy never command realization desires fine conclude code morals thought reviewing different occupations men life view making choice best without wishing offer remarks employments others state conviction better continue engaged viz devoting whole life culture reason making greatest progress able knowledge truth principles method prescribed method time begun apply source satisfaction intense lead believe perfect innocent enjoyed life means daily discovered truths appeared importance men generally ignorant gratification thence arising occupied mind wholly indifferent every object besides preceding maxims founded singly design continuing work self instruction since god endowed light reason distinguish truth error believed ought single moment rest satisfied opinions another unless resolved exercise judgment examining whenever duly qualified task proceeded opinions without scruple supposed thereby forfeit advantage attaining still accurate exist fine restrained desires remained satisfied followed path thought certain attaining knowledge acquisition competent well largest amount truly good ever hope secure inasmuch neither seek shun object except far understanding represents good bad necessary right action right judgment best action correct judgment acquisition virtues else truly valuable within reach assurance acquisition cannot fail render contented thus provided maxims placed reserve along truths faith ever occupied first place belief came conclusion might freedom set ridding remained opinions inasmuch hoped better able successfully accomplish work holding intercourse mankind remaining longer shut retirement thoughts occurred betook traveling winter well ended subsequent years nothing roam place another desirous spectator rather actor plays exhibited theater world made business matter reflect particularly upon might fairly doubted prove source error gradually rooted mind errors hitherto crept imitated sceptics doubt doubt seek nothing beyond uncertainty contrary design singly find ground assurance cast aside loose earth sand might reach rock clay appears successful enough since endeavored discover falsehood incertitude propositions examined feeble conjectures clear certain reasonings met nothing doubtful yield conclusion adequate certainty although merely inference matter question contained nothing certain pulling old house usually reserve ruins contribute towards erection destroying opinions judged ill founded made variety observations acquired amount experience availed establishment certain continued exercise method prescribed besides taking care general conduct thoughts according rules reserved hours time time expressly devoted employment method solution mathematical difficulties even solution likewise questions belonging sciences detached principles sciences inadequate certainty rendered almost mathematical truth manifest numerous examples contained volume thus without appearance living otherwise occupation spending lives agreeably innocently study sever pleasure vice enjoy leisure without ennui recourse pursuits honorable nevertheless prosecuting design making greater progress knowledge truth might perhaps made engaged perusal books merely holding converse men letters years passed away however come determinate judgment respecting difficulties form matter dispute among learned commenced seek principles philosophy certain vulgar examples many men highest genius former times engaged inquiry appeared without success led imagine work much difficulty perhaps ventured soon heard currently rumored already completed inquiry know grounds opinion conversation contributed measure rise must happened rather confessed ignorance greater freedom accustomed studied little expounded perhaps reasons led doubt many things others esteemed certain boasted system philosophy disposition makes unwilling esteemed different really thought necessary endeavor means render worthy reputation accorded exactly years since desire constrained remove places interruption acquaintances possible betake country long duration war led establishment discipline armies maintained seem use enabling inhabitants enjoy securely blessings peace midst great crowd actively engaged business careful affairs curious others enabled live without deprived conveniences populous cities yet solitary retired midst remote deserts part iv doubt propriety making first meditations place mentioned matter discourse metaphysical uncommon perhaps acceptable every yet determined whether foundations laid sufficiently secure find measure constrained advert long remarked relation practice sometimes necessary adopt doubt opinions discern highly uncertain already said desired give attention solely search truth thought procedure exactly opposite called ought reject absolutely false opinions regard suppose least ground doubt order ascertain whether remained aught belief wholly indubitable accordingly seeing senses sometimes deceive willing suppose existed nothing really presented men err reasoning fall paralogisms even simplest matters geometry convinced open error rejected false reasonings hitherto taken demonstrations finally considered thoughts presentations experience awake also experienced asleep time true supposed objects presentations ever entered mind awake truth illusions dreams immediately upon observed whilst thus wished think false absolutely necessary thus thought somewhat observed truth think therefore cogito ergo sum certain evidence ground doubt however extravagant alleged sceptics capable shaking concluded might without scruple accept first principle philosophy search next place attentively examined observed suppose body world place might therefore suppose contrary circumstance thought doubt truth things clearly certainly followed hand ceased think although objects ever imagined reality existent reason believe existed thence concluded substance whose whole essence nature consists thinking exist need place dependent material thing say mind wholly distinct body even easily known latter although latter still continue inquired general essential truth certainty proposition since discovered knew true thought must likewise able discover ground certitude observed words think therefore nothing gives assurance truth beyond see clearly order think necessary exist concluded might take general rule principle things clearly distinctly conceive true observing however difficulty rightly determining objects distinctly conceive next place reflecting circumstance doubted consequently wholly perfect clearly saw greater perfection know doubt led inquire whence learned think something perfect clearly recognized must hold notion nature reality perfect thoughts many objects external sky earth light heat thousand less loss know whence came since remarked nothing seemed render superior believe true dependencies nature far possessed certain perfection false held nothing say certain imperfection nature case idea nature perfect receive nothing thing manifestly impossible less repugnant perfect effect dependence less perfect something proceed nothing equally impossible hold accordingly remained placed nature reality perfect mine even possessed within perfections form idea say single word god added since knew perfections possess existence permission freely use terms schools contrary necessity perfect upon dependent received possessed existed alone independently every perfection however little actually possessed able reason whole remainder perfection want conscious thus become infinite eternal immutable omniscient powerful fine possessed perfections recognize god order know nature god whose existence established preceding reasonings far nature permitted consider reference properties found mind idea whether possession mark perfection assured indicated imperfection none rest awanting thus perceived doubt inconstancy sadness like found god since happy free besides ideas many sensible corporeal things although might suppose dreaming saw imagined false nevertheless deny ideas reality thoughts already clearly recognized intelligent nature distinct corporeal observed composition evidence dependency state dependency manifestly state imperfection therefore determined perfection god compounded natures consequently compounded bodies world even intelligences natures wholly perfect existence depended power way subsist without single moment disposed straightway search truths represented object geometers conceived continuous body space indefinitely extended length breadth height depth divisible divers parts admit different figures sizes moved transposed manner ways geometers suppose object contemplate went simplest demonstrations first place observed great certitude common consent accorded demonstrations founded solely upon clearly conceived accordance rules already laid next place perceived nothing demonstrations assure existence object thus example supposing triangle given distinctly perceived angles necessarily equal right angles account perceive anything assure triangle existed contrary recurring examination idea perfect found existence comprised idea way equality angles right angles comprised idea triangle idea sphere equidistance points surface center even still clearly consequently least certain god perfect exists demonstration geometry reason leads many persuade selves difficulty knowing truth even also knowing mind really never raise thoughts sensible objects accustomed consider nothing except way imagination mode thinking limited material objects imaginable seems intelligible truth sufficiently manifest single circumstance philosophers schools accept maxim nothing understanding previously senses however certain ideas god soul never appears make use imagination comprehend ideas exactly thing order hear sounds smell odors strove avail eyes unless indeed difference sense sight afford inferior assurance smell hearing place neither imagination senses give assurance anything unless understanding intervene finally still persons sufficiently persuaded existence god soul reasons adduced desirous know propositions truth deem perhaps assured body exist stars earth like less certain although moral assurance things strong appearance extravagance doubting existence yet time unless intellect impaired deny question relates metaphysical certitude sufficient reason exclude entire assurance observation asleep way imagine possessed another body see stars another earth nothing kind know thoughts occur dreaming false rather experience awake since former often less vivid distinct latter though men highest genius study question long please believe able give reason sufficient remove doubt unless presuppose existence god first place even principle already taken rule viz things clearly distinctly conceive true certain god exists perfect possess derived whence follows ideas notions extent clearness distinctness real proceed god must extent true accordingly whereas infrequently ideas notions falsity contained case extent confused obscure proceed nothing participate negation exist thus confused wholly perfect evident less repugnant falsity imperfection far imperfection proceed god truth perfection proceed nothing know possess real true proceeds perfect infinite however clear distinct ideas might ground account assurance possessed perfection true knowledge god soul rendered certain rule easily understand truth thoughts experience awake ought slightest degree called question account illusions dreams happened individual even asleep distinct idea example geometer discover new demonstration circumstance asleep militate truth ordinary error dreams consists representing various objects way external senses prejudicial since leads properly suspect truth ideas sense infrequently deceived manner awake persons jaundice see objects yellow stars bodies great distance appear much smaller fine whether awake asleep ought never allow persuaded truth anything unless evidence reason must noted say reason imagination senses thus example although clearly see sun ought therefore determine size sense sight presents distinctly imagine head lion joined body goat without therefore shut conclusion chimaera exists dictate reason thus see imagine reality existent plainly tells ideas notions contain truth otherwise god wholly perfect veracious placed reasonings never clear complete sleep awake although sometimes acts imagination lively distinct waking moments reason dictates since thoughts cannot true partial imperfection possessing truth must infallibly found experience waking moments rather dreams part v willingly proceeded exhibit whole chain truths deduced primary view necessary treat many questions dispute among earned wish embroiled believe better refrain exposition mention general truths judicious able determine whether special account conduce public advantage ever remained firm original resolution suppose principle recently availed demonstrating existence god soul accept true nothing appear clear certain demonstrations geometers formerly appeared yet venture state found means satisfy short time principal difficulties usually treated philosophy also observed certain laws established nature god manner impressed minds notions reflected sufficiently upon cannot doubt accurately observed exists takes place world farther considering concatenation laws appears discovered many truths useful important learned even expected learn essayed expound chief discoveries treatise certain considerations prevent publishing cannot make results known conveniently giving summary contents treatise design comprise set write thought knew nature material objects like painters finding unable represent equally well plain surface different faces solid body select chief alone make light fall throwing rest shade allow appear far seen looking principal fearing lest able compense discourse mind resolved expound singly though considerable length opinions regarding light take opportunity adding something sun fixed stars since light almost wholly proceeds heavens since transmit planets comets earth since reflect particularly bodies upon earth since either colored transparent luminous finally man since spectator objects enable cast variety subjects somewhat shade express judgment regarding greater freedom without necessitated adopt refute opinions learned resolved leave people disputes speak happen new world god create somewhere imaginary spaces matter sufficient compose agitate variously confusedly different parts matter resulted chaos disordered poets ever feigned nothing lend ordinary concurrence nature allow act accordance laws established supposition first place described matter essayed represent manner mind nothing clearer intelligible except recently said regarding god soul even expressly supposed possessed none forms qualities debated schools general anything knowledge natural minds much imagine ignorant besides pointed laws nature principle upon found reasonings except infinite perfection god endeavored demonstrate room doubt prove even god created worlds none laws observed thereafter showed greatest part matter chaos must accordance laws dispose arrange way present appearance heavens meantime parts must compose earth planets comets others sun fixed stars making digression stage subject light expounded considerable length nature light must found sun stars thence instant time traverses immense spaces heavens planets comets reflected towards earth likewise added much respecting substance situation motions different qualities heavens stars thought said enough respecting show nothing observable heavens stars system must least appear precisely alike system described came next speak earth particular show even though expressly supposed god given weight matter composed prevent parts tending exactly center water air surface disposition heavens heavenly bodies especially moon must cause flow ebb like circumstances observed seas also certain current water air east west likewise observed tropics mountains seas fountains rivers might naturally formed metals produced mines plants grow fields general bodies commonly denominated mixed composite might generated among things discoveries alluded inasmuch besides stars knew nothing except fire produces light spared pains set forth pertains nature manner production support explain heat sometimes found without light light without heat show induce various colors upon different bodies diverse qualities reduces liquid state hardens others consume almost bodies convert ashes smoke finally ashes mere intensity action forms glass transmutation ashes glass appeared wonderful nature took special pleasure describing however disposed circumstances conclude world created manner described much likely god made first certain opinion commonly received among theologians action sustains originally created even although beginning given form chaos provided established certain laws nature lent concurrence enable act wont believed without discredit miracle creation way alone things purely material might course time become observe present nature much easily conceived beheld coming manner gradually existence considered produced finished perfect state description inanimate bodies plants passed animals particularly man since yet sufficient knowledge enable treat manner rest say deducing effects causes showing elements manner nature must produce remained satisfied supposition god formed body man wholly like well external shape members internal conformation organs matter described first placed rational soul principle room vegetative sensitive soul beyond kindling heart fires without light already described thought different heat hay heaped together dry causes fermentation new wines run clear fruit examined kind functions might consequences supposition exist body found precisely exist independently power thinking consequently without measure owing soul words part distinct body said nature distinctively consists thinking functions animals void reason said wholly resemble among discover dependent thought alone belong men hand afterwards discover soon supposed god created rational soul annexed body particular manner described order show handled matter mean give explication motion heart arteries first general motion observed animals afford means readily determining thought rest less difficulty understanding say subject advise versed anatomy commence perusal observations take trouble getting dissected presence heart large animal possessed lungs throughout sufficiently like human shown ventricles cavities first place right side correspond ample tubes viz hollow vein vena cava principal receptacle blood trunk tree veins body branches arterial vein vena arteriosa inappropriately denominated since truth artery taking rise heart divided passing many branches presently disperse lungs second place cavity left side correspond manner canals size equal larger preceding viz venous artery arteria venosa likewise inappropriately thus designated simply vein comes lungs divided many branches interlaced arterial vein tube called windpipe air breathe enters great artery issuing heart sends branches body wish also persons carefully shown eleven pellicles like many small valves open shut orifices cavities viz entrance hollow veins disposed manner means prevent blood contains flowing right ventricle heart yet exactly prevent flowing entrance arterial vein arranged manner exactly opposite former readily permit blood contained cavity pass lungs hinder contained lungs returning cavity like manner others mouth venous artery allow blood lungs flow left cavity heart preclude return mouth great artery suffer blood flow heart prevent reflux need seek reason number pellicles beyond orifice venous artery oval shape nature situation adequately closed whereas others round conveniently closed besides wish persons observe grand artery arterial vein much harder firmer texture venous artery hollow vein last expand entering heart form pouches denominated auricles heart composed substance similar heart always warmth heart part body finally heat capable causing drop blood passes cavities rapidly expand dilate liquors allowed fall drop drop highly heated vessel things necessary say anything view explain motion heart except cavities full blood blood necessity flows hollow vein right venous artery left vessels always full blood orifices turned towards heart cannot closed soon drops blood thus passed cavities drops cannot large orifices pass wide vessels come full blood immediately rarefied dilated heat meet way cause whole heart expand time press home shut small valves entrances vessels flow thus prevent blood coming heart becoming rarefied push open small valves orifices vessels pass causing way branches arterial vein grand artery expand almost simultaneously heart immediately thereafter begins contract also arteries blood entered cooled small valves close hollow vein venous artery open anew allow passage drops blood cause heart arteries expand blood thus enters heart passes pouches called auricles thence happens motion contrary heart expands contract lest ignorant force mathematical demonstrations accustomed distinguish true reasons mere verisimilitudes venture without examination deny said wish considered motion explained follows necessarily arrangement parts observed heart eye alone heat felt fingers nature blood learned experience motion clock power situation shape counterweights wheels asked happens blood veins flowing way continually heart exhausted arteries become full since blood passes heart flows need mention reply written physician england honor broken ice subject first teach many small passages extremities arteries blood received heart passes small branches veins whence returns heart course amounts precisely perpetual circulation abundant proof ordinary experience surgeons binding arm tie moderate straitness part open vein cause blood flow copiously done without ligature whereas quite contrary happen bind hand opening make ligature opening tight manifest tie moderately straightened adequate hinder blood already arm returning towards heart veins cannot account prevent new blood coming forward arteries situated veins coverings greater consistency difficult compress also blood comes heart tends pass hand greater force return hand heart veins since latter current escapes arm opening made veins must necessity certain passages ligature towards extremities arm come thither arteries physician likewise abundantly establishes advanced respecting motion blood existence certain pellicles disposed various places along course veins manner small valves permit blood pass middle body towards extremities return extremities heart farther experience shows blood body flow short time single artery cut even although closely tied immediate neighborhood heart cut heart ligature prevent supposition blood flowing come quarter heart many circumstances evince alleged true cause motion blood thus first place difference observed blood flows veins arteries arise rarefied distilled passing heart thinner vivid warmer immediately leaving heart words arteries short time passing either words veins attention given found difference marked neighborhood heart evident parts remote next place consistency coats arterial vein great artery composed sufficiently shows blood impelled force veins left cavity heart great artery wider larger right cavity arterial vein blood venous artery lungs passed heart thinner rarefies readily higher degree blood proceeds immediately hollow vein physicians conjecture feeling pulse unless know according blood changes nature rarefied warmth heart higher lower degree less quickly inquired heat communicated members must admitted effected means blood passing heart heated anew thence diffused body whence happens blood withdrawn part heat likewise withdrawn means although heart hot glowing iron capable warming feet hands present unless continually sent thither new blood likewise perceive true use respiration bring sufficient fresh air lungs cause blood flows right ventricle heart rarefied changed vapors become thick convert anew blood flows left cavity without process unfit nourishment fire receives confirmation circumstance observed animals destitute lungs also cavity heart children cannot use womb hole blood flows hollow vein left cavity heart tube passes arterial vein grand artery without passing lung next place digestion carried stomach unless heart communicated heat arteries along certain fluid parts blood assist dissolution food taken also operation converts juice food blood easily comprehended considered distilled passing repassing heart perhaps hundred times day need adduced explain nutrition production different humors body beyond saying force blood rarefied passes heart towards extremities arteries causes certain parts remain members arrive occupy place others expelled according situation shape smallness pores meet rather others flow certain parts way sieves observed act variously perforated serve separate different species grain last place worthy observation generation animal spirits like subtle wind rather pure vivid flame continually ascending great abundance heart brain thence penetrates nerves muscles gives motion members account parts blood agitated penetrating fittest compose spirits proceeding towards brain necessary suppose cause simply arteries carry thither proceed heart direct lines according rules mechanics nature many objects tend point sufficient room case parts blood flow forth left cavity heart tend towards brain weaker less agitated parts must necessarily driven aside point stronger alone way reach expounded matters sufficient minuteness treatise formerly thought publishing shown must fabric nerves muscles human body give animal spirits contained power move members see heads shortly struck still move bite earth although longer animated changes must take place brain produce waking sleep dreams light sounds odors tastes heat qualities external objects impress different ideas means senses hunger thirst internal affections likewise impress upon divers ideas must understood common sense sensus communis ideas received memory retains fantasy change various ways compose new ideas means distributing animal spirits muscles cause members body move many different ways manner suited whether objects presented senses internal affections take place case apart guidance appear strange acquainted variety movements performed different automata moving machines fabricated human industry help pieces compared great multitude bones muscles nerves arteries veins parts found body animal persons look upon body machine made hands god incomparably better arranged adequate movements admirable machine human invention specially stayed show machines exactly resembling organs outward form ape irrational animal means knowing respect different nature animals machines bearing image bodies capable imitating actions far morally possible still remain certain tests whereby know therefore really men first never use words signs arranged manner competent order declare thoughts others easily conceive machine constructed emits vocables even emits correspondent action upon external objects cause change organs example touched particular place demand wish say another cry hurt like arrange variously appositely reply said presence men lowest grade intellect second test although machines might execute many things equal perhaps greater perfection without doubt fail certain others discovered act knowledge solely disposition organs reason universal instrument alike available every occasion organs contrary need particular arrangement particular action whence must morally impossible exist machine diversity organs sufficient enable act occurrences life way reason enables act means tests likewise know difference men brutes highly deserving remark men dull stupid even idiots incapable joining together different words thereby constructing declaration make thoughts understood hand animal however perfect happily circumstanced like inability arise want organs observe magpies parrots utter words like yet unable speak show understand say place men born deaf dumb thus less rather brutes destitute organs others use speaking habit spontaneously inventing certain signs discover thoughts usually company leisure learn language proves brutes less reason man none see little required enable person speak since certain inequality capacity observable among animals species well among men since capable instructed others incredible perfect ape parrot species equal stupid infant kind least crack brained unless soul brutes nature wholly different ought confound speech natural movements indicate passions imitated machines well manifested animals must thought certain ancients brutes speak although understand language case since endowed many organs analogous easily communicate thoughts fellows also worthy remark though many animals manifest industry certain actions animals yet observed show none many others circumstance better prove endowed mind thence follow possessed greater reason surpass things contrary rather proves destitute reason nature acts according disposition organs thus seen clock composed wheels weights number hours measure time exactly skin described reasonable soul shown means educed power matter things spoken must expressly created sufficient lodged human body exactly like pilot ship unless perhaps move members necessary joined united closely body order sensations appetites similar thus constitute real man entered conclusion upon subject soul considerable length greatest moment error deny existence god error think already sufficiently refuted none powerful leading feeble minds astray straight path virtue supposition soul brutes nature consequently life nothing hope fear flies ants place know far differ much better comprehend reasons establish soul nature wholly independent body consequently liable die latter finally causes observed capable destroying naturally led thence judge immortal part vi years elapsed since finished treatise containing matters beginning revise view put hands printer learned persons greatly defer whose authority actions hardly less influential reason thoughts condemned certain doctrine physics published short time previously another individual say adhered previously censure observed nothing imagine prejudicial either religion state nothing therefore prevented giving expression writing reason persuaded truth led fear lest among doctrines likewise might found departed truth notwithstanding great care always taken accord belief new opinions certain demonstrations give expression aught might tend hurt sufficient make alter purpose publishing although reasons induced take resolution strong yet inclination always hostile writing books enabled immediately discover considerations sufficient excuse undertaking task reasons side measure interest state public perhaps know never made much account
