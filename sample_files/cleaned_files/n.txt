clear accurate definitions really essential terms constantly increasing interest music study private public schools present persistent demand music teaching shall become systematic therefore efficient turning intelligent class pupils become increasingly necessary establish courses prospective teacher music considerable experience music might acquire concise accurate knowledge fairly large number terms probably already encountered student many knows general meaning none perhaps knows accurately enough enable impart knowledge clearly economically others meet need text book purpose classes

increased either addition short lines called leger lines notes written either lines spaces footnote word leger derived french word l ger meaning light use word refers fact leger lines added hand

character causes degree staff associated represent pitch half step higher otherwise thus fig fifth line first space represent pitch f fig b staff degrees represent entirely different tone f sharp student note sharp raise anything merely causes staff degree represent higher tone otherwise much difference f f sharp b c yet never think referring c b raised illustration fig flat character causes degree staff associated represent tone half step lower otherwise see note sec apply discussion double sharp causes staff degree placed represent pitch whole step higher without sharp similarly double flat causes staff degree placed represent pitch whole step lower without flat double sharps double flats generally used staff degrees already sharped flatted therefore practical effect cause staff degrees represent pitches respectively half step higher half step lower represented degrees diatonic condition thus fig b first space diatonic condition represents f sharp double sharp degree cause represent pitch half step higher f sharp e f double sharp footnote expression diatonic condition used refers staff signature placed upon words staff prepared represent pitches diatonic scale chapter
