Eternity, neither end beginning, baffles profound human thought. impossible think point beyond absolutely nothing, imagine passing million years without bringing day minute nearer close. Suppose fix upon terminal point, still fancy something beyond , period still remote present , _ad infinitum_. insurmountable difficulty confronts seek imagine First Cause. God beginning, yet seems finite minds, something must brought existence, conclude back creating Power must another originating cause, perhaps still another, without limitation. yet know must period everything void, , words, nothing. awful grandeur loneliness, desolation, chaos, God know, however, existed called universe . , present finite condition, ever comprehend stupendous birth contained opening first chapter Genesis. story creation told God chosen people, Hebrews, alone selected nations existing upon earth receive wonderful revelation.

Greeks Romans, time remote history gives account , neither land water, earth things within upon "without form void." misty, nebulous mixing mingling brooded god Chaos, shared throne Nox, goddess night. union innumerable myths gradually sprang developed, imaginative though often grotesque way explained various phases creation. finally became crystallized literature, mythology, since inspiration alike romancers poets. learned mythologists differ analysis multitude myths descended . varying analyses, however, separated distinct classes divisions, adherents supporters. first school philologists, second anthropologists, comparative mythologists. Philology relates study language, especially treated philosophical manner. school maintains myths origin "disease language, pearl result disease oyster." key, therefore, mythologies, say, found language. names originally applied gods generally referred phenomena clouds, winds, rain, sunshine, etc. Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, great languages antiquity, demonstrate, foundation single source still older. proof position, point similarity ordinary words various languages family, show undergone trifling changes. greatest authority among philologists claims "first period" tribe Central Asia, whose language consisted -syllable words, contained germs Turanian, Aryan, Semitic tongues. age termed Rhematic period, succeeded Nomadic Agglutinative age, language gradually "received, , peculiar impress formative system still find dialects national idioms comprised name Aryan Semitic," includes thousand dialects. authority follows Agglutinative period "represented everywhere characteristic features, called Mythological, Mythopoeic age." name implies, last-mentioned period saw evolution development mythic lore. American Indians -day, primitive man, crude way, explained operation physical laws giving inanimate objects like passions sentiments . tempest rages, crashing lightning splinters mountain oak, Indian says Great Spirit angry. nature becomes serene calm, Great Spirit pleased. malign forces around , work ill warrior, , say, direct doings evil spirit. Even heavenly bodies personified, "poetry far kept alive minds old animative theory nature, great effort fancy waterspout huge giant sea-monster, depict, call appropriate metaphor, march across field ocean." Since names Greek heroes gods show general correspondence Sanskrit appellations physical things, comparatively easy understand many first fancies reflections earliest men ever lived. argument philologists fancies reflections settled definite shape far-away period nations, spread remotest corners earth, dwelt together used common language. Following gradual scattering single, unified people, language became sensitive change, many words losing original meaning, , instances, acquiring opposite significance. words, , course time utterly lost. "long personified beings Heaven Sun consciously talked mythic language, meaning legends open question, action ascribed , rule, natural appropriate." time came, however, names considered simply applying heroes deities, amid jumble confusion succeeding ages became well-nigh impossible trace myths back original source meaning. brief outline myth interpretations, made philologists. Anthropology defined study man, considered entire nature. explaining mythology, anthropologists say "man, human thought human language combined, naturally necessarily produced strange conglomerate ancient fable." Instead, therefore, seeking source myths language, second class find "condition thought races passed." argument anthropologists nations come parent-stock, claimed also philologists, yet various peoples, primitive savage state, passed like low intellectual condition growth. folk-lore countries shows savages consider nature beasts, regard "even plants, inanimate objects, abstract phenomena persons human parts passions." Every religion antedating Christianity inculcated worship idols, usually take form beasts, noted study myths gods often assume forms birds animals. power mentally become savages time, look upon nature surroundings Blackfeet Indians, Patagonians, South Africans, long step toward making clear particular phase question. stated, however, young student gain idea meaning word "myth," termed story whose origin never known certainty. people significance fable, legendary tale, fanciful falsehood. collection myths belonging particular age people "mythology," branch inquiry classifies interprets bears name.
