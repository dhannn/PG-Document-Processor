arise narrow personal pride selfish interest rather fact warm approval educational public proved important point namely fundamental truths psychology put simply concretely made interest value students ages high school juniors general public well encouraging still demonstrated teachings psychology become immediately helpful study teaching also business profession control guidance personal life problems met routine day work play effecting present revision salient features original edition kept truths presented fundamental important field psychology disputed theories unsettled opinions excluded subject matter made concrete practical use many illustrations application real problems style kept easy familiar facilitate reading short seeking improve volume conscious purpose omit none characteristics secured acceptance former edition hand certain changes additions made believed add strength work first later psychological studies investigations drawn upon insure matter shall points abreast times scientific accuracy wide use text training teachers specific educational application schoolroom problems made various chapters exercises guidance observation work personal introspection freely used chapter sensation perception separated chapters subject given extensive treatment new chapter added association various chapters subdivided numbered sections cut paragraph topics used facilitate study teaching text minor changes additions occur throughout volume thus adding forty pages number original edition many modifications made revision due valuable suggestions kindly criticisms received many teachers text various types schools thus helped generously freely giving author fruits judgment experience gladly renders grateful thanks cornell college iowa contents chapter

long time many nervous systems contain cell elements less immature forming functional part tissue yet conditions capable development cells continually appearing developing cortex source known nuclei granules found earliest stages elements metamorphosed neuroblasts elementary cells nervous matter developed shrunken volume less first remain small subsequent process enlargement necessary full development expand well marked cells elements intermediate granules fully developed cells always found even mature brains therefore inferred latter derived former appearances also lead conclusion many elements might possibly develop given case far beyond number actually possible number cells latent functional central system early fixed age number accordingly represented granules well cells already undergone development growth proportion developed cells increases sometimes owing failure recognize potential nerve cells granules impression carried away increase implies formation new elements shown case development nerve fibers nerve fibers less cells must go process development already shown fibers result branching cells birth many cells yet thrown branches hence fibers lacking many already grown sufficiently developed transmit impulses accurately thus found children birth able support weight body several seconds clasping fingers around small rod takes year child become able stand
